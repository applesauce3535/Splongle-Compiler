# Splongle Programming Language Compiler
A compiler for my very own programming language which I am currently working on. This project
was started as a way to learn the details of language design, deepen my knowledge of low-level
programming, and bolster my C++ skills. I hope to make a Turing-complete language, then see where
to take it from there.
# Current features
Currently the language supports sending exit codes and initialization of integer and double primitive
data types. All arithmetic operations have been implemented, however order of operations is yet to come, and operations on 
floating-point values will follow shortly after.
# Future features
<ul> 
  <li>Character data types</li>
  <li>I/O support</li>
  <li>Arrays</li>
  <li>Control structures (if and else, for-loops, while-loops)</li>
  <li>Scoping</li>
  <li>Subprograms</li>
</ul>
