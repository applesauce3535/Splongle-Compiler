# Splongle Programming Language Compiler
A compiler for my very own programming language which I am currently working on. This project
was started as a way to learn the details of language design, deepen my knowledge of low-level
programming, and bolster my C++ skills. I hope to make a Turing-complete language, then see where
to take it from there.
# Current features
Currently the language supports sending exit codes and initialization of integer and double primitive
data types. Arithmetic is being worked on.
# Future features
<ul> 
  <li>Character data types</li>
  <li>I/O support</li>
  <li>Arrays</li>
  <li>Control structures (if and else, for-loops, while-loops)</li>
  <li>Scoping</li>
  <li>Subprograms</li>
</ul>
