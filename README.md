# Splongle Programming Language Compiler
A compiler for my very own programming language which I am currently working on. This project
was started as a way to learn the details of language design, deepen my knowledge of low-level
programming, and bolster my C++ skills. I hope to make a Turing-complete language, then see where
to take it from there.
